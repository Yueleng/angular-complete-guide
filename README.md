## Course Structure

- Getting Started
- The Basics: what are components, what did we do with two-way data-binding and how does that all work.
- Component & Data-binding: Angular apps are built up from components and data binding is simply how you output your DOM in the end and react to user events.
- Directives: `[(ngModel)]` with two-way data-binding is such a directive.
- Services & and Dependency Injection: Angular makes it really easy to bundle pieces of codes in your app, make pieces communicate with each other, and to centrialize code and to manage the state of your application.
- Routing: The management of different URLs, to the users, it looks like we're switching pages, even though technically, we will still remain on that single page.
- Observables: It is a concept allowing you to work with async code. (Async Loading)
- Forms: Handling forms, handling user input, is a key task of almost any application.
- Pipes: Transform the code to output to the browser at runtime.
- Http: Connects Angular app to the server.
- Authentication: Authenticate the user
- Optimizations & Modules
- Deployment: From local machine to the Internet.
- Animcations & Testing
